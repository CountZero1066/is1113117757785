  <p><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/eu/"><img src="https://luxent.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/salesforcelogo.png" alt="saas" style="width:200px;height:150px;margin-left:15px;"></a>Platform as a Service (PaaS) or application platform as a Service (aPaaS) or platform base service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. PaaS can be delivered in three ways: as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS), middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.), database and other services to host the consumer's application; as a private service (software or appliance) inside the firewall; or as software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.</p>
  <p>The advantages of PaaS are primarily that it allows for higher-level programming with dramatically reduced complexity; the overall development of the application can be more effective, as it has built-in/self up-and-down ramping infrastructure resources; and maintenance and enhancement of the application is thus easier.</p>
  <p>There are several types of PaaS, including public, private and hybrid. PaaS was originally intended for applications on public cloud services, before expanding to include private and hybrid options.

Public PaaS is derived from software as a service (SaaS), and is situated in cloud computing between SaaS and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). SaaS is software that is hosted in the cloud, so that it doesn't take up hard drive from the computer of the user or the servers of a company. IaaS provides virtual hardware from a provider with adjustable scalability. With IaaS, the user still has to manage the server, whereas with PaaS the server management is done by the provider.

Amazon AWS, Oracle Cloud Platform, Jelastic and Heroku are some of the commercial public cloud PaaS providers.

A private PaaS can typically be downloaded and installed either in a company's on-premises data center, or in a public cloud. Once the software is installed on one or more machines, the private PaaS arranges the application and database components into a single hosting platform. Private PaaS vendors include Apprenda, which started out on the Microsoft .NET platform before rolling out a Java PaaS; Red Hat's OpenShift and Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

Hybrid PaaS is typically a deployment consisting of a mix of public and private deployments.</p>

Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware. Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers. Containerisation offers higher performance than virtualization, because there is no hypervisor overhead. Also, container capacity auto-scales dynamically with computing load, which eliminates the problem of over-provisioning and enables usage-based billing. IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks (VLANs), and software bundles</p>
  <p>According to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the most basic cloud-service model is that of providers offering IT infrastructure — virtual machines and other resources — as a service to subscribers.

IaaS-cloud providers supply these resources on-demand from their large pools of equipment installed in data centers. For wide-area connectivity, customers can use either the Internet or carrier clouds (dedicated virtual private networks). To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure.[unreliable source?] In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the amount of resources allocated and consumed</p>

SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support. Other benefits of the SaaS model include:

Flexible payments: Rather than purchasing software to install, or additional hardware to support it, customers subscribe to a SaaS offering. Generally, they pay for this service on a monthly basis using a pay-as-you-go model. Transitioning costs to a recurring operating expense allows many businesses to exercise better and more predictable budgeting. Users can also terminate SaaS offerings at any time to stop those recurring costs.

Scalable usage: Cloud services like SaaS offer high scalability, which gives customers the option to access more, or fewer, services or features on-demand.</p>
  <p>Automatic updates: Rather than purchasing new software, customers can rely on a SaaS provider to automatically perform updates and patch management. This further reduces the burden on in-house IT staff.</p>
  <p>Accessibility and persistence: Since SaaS applications are delivered over the Internet, users can access them from any Internet-enabled device and location.

But SaaS also poses some potential disadvantages. Businesses must rely on outside vendors to provide the software, keep that software up and running, track and report accurate billing and facilitate a secure environment for the business' data. Providers that experience service disruptions, impose unwanted changes to service offerings, experience a security breach or any other issue can have a profound effect on the customers' ability to use those SaaS offerings. As a result, users should understand their SaaS provider's service-level agreement, and make sure it is enforced.

SaaS is closely related to the ASP (application service provider) and on demand computing software delivery models. The hosted application management model of SaaS is similar to ASP: the provider hosts the customer’s software and delivers it to approved end users over the internet.  In the software on demand SaaS model, the provider gives customers network-based access to a single copy of an application that the provider created specifically for SaaS distribution. The application’s source code is the same for all customers and when new features are functionalities are rolled out, they are rolled out to all customers. Depending upon the service level agreement (SLA), the customer’s data for each model may be stored locally, in the cloud or both locally and in the cloud.</p>

Organizations may use these and similar services to lower costs and increase efficiency for business processes involving audio or video telecommunications.</p>
  <p>CaaS is part of a larger category of services known as software as a service (SaaS), in which vendors offer software products and services over the Internet. It is also an alternative to the traditional model of buying and installing licensed software on site.

The core concept of CaaS is that accessing these services over the internet is extremely convenient. The client businesses do not have to worry about maintaining servers and connections, uploading different kinds of content or doing all of the administrative work involved in keeping a communications platform functional. Business users just sign in and use the services. Types of CaaS include Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or internet telephone solutions, and video conferencing services.

Businesses have designed specific video conferencing products in which users can sign via the Internet and participate as necessary. Vendors can then bill the business according to its participation. The convenience and utility of CaaS and similar services are rapidly expanding the business world. It is part of a greater trend toward cloud computing services and other remote services used by businesses to reduce overhead or optimize business processes.</p>
